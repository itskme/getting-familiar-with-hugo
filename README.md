My first ever hugo site. Time was spent end-to-end, from downloading hugo to building and running the server and customizing. View it here: https://itskme.github.io/getting-familiar-with-hugo/

I have no idea why the CSS isn't loading, it loads when I did a quick test on my IDE. (view screenshot above)


if you want to use this project for yourself, I reccomend checking out [the hugo project](https://gohugo.io/) and making a site just like this for yourself :)
